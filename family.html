My name is Nur Ain Faatihah binti mohd Anuar.I am 21 years old. I was born on February 18, 2003 in Hospital Sultanah Nur Zahirah, Kuala Terengganu. I have 4 siblings and I am the eldest. My hobby is walking and enjoying nature. Then,
I would describe myself as a quiet and random. Mostly, I will do whatever that are cross on my mind at that time and somehow, it's make people around me happy with it.

    <td>This is Aishah, the youngest one. On this year, she turns to 12. The age gap between me and her is 9 years old. For me, it was really challenging to communicate with her because she has a very different personality with me. She likes to socialize and talk too much, but sometimes she has cross the limit. When I give her the advice, she doesn't care it too much and don't respect me as the eldest. However, she has a pure heart and likes to help others the most among us. For example, she will give her brother and sisters her money whenever we say don't have it. She was very popular among the teachers at her school beacuse of her friendly personality.</td></h2>
