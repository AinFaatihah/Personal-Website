    <td>As a person that didn't like to take a photo, it's hard for me to find a photo that have my face in it. Whenever my friends ask me to take some photos together, I will run away and avoid it as I could. So, this photo holds such a special place in my heart. Whenever I look at this photo, I'm transported back to exact moment. The scene, the atmosphere, the emotions-it's like I'm there again. This picture was taken on last week before our SPM last paper. They force me to join them touring the school and hostel together for the last time. As you can see, my face is not really happy in that picture because I really hate to take a picture. But, as I grow older, I realize that those memories in secondary school is the most precious things I ever have. I don't have a words to tell how grateful I am to call them as my friends.

    <td>After form 5, I'm further my study in STPM at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Agama Durian Guling (SMKADG). This is me and my friend, faeizah. This picture was taken in a bus and we're on our way to celebrating graduation day as a STPM students at other place. Faeizah is a very kind person. She is very social butterfly person I have ever met. Moreover, she was really popular at that time beacuse she is the face of Master of ceremony (MC), beautiful, friendly with all of students at that school and smart. Now, she has further her study in UnisZa and still active in MC. </td>
